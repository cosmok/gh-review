# Repository Review Guidance

- When reviewing diffs, assume that unchanged lines are intentionally omitted.
- Focus feedback strictly on the lines presented in the diff.
- Use surrounding context only when necessary to understand the change.
- Avoid comments suggesting code was deleted unless the diff shows removals.
