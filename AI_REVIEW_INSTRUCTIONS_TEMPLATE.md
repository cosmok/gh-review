# Custom AI Review Instructions Template

Create a copy of this file named `AI_REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md` in your repository's root or within any folder to provide additional guidance to the automated reviewer.

Recommended sections:

- **Purpose** - Briefly describe the goal of the repository or folder.
- **Code Style** - Bullet points summarizing style or lint rules.
- **Testing Requirements** - Outline required tests or commands to run.
- **Documentation** - Notes about updating docs when code changes.
- **Cross Repository Tasks** - Reminders to sync changes to other repos or packages.

Edit or remove sections as needed. The contents will be included in the review prompts for files within the same directory hierarchy.
